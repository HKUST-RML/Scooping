# Scooping
# 1. Overview
A novel dexterous robotic manipulation technique which we called Scooping is implemented by this package. The work implies autonoumus picking of thin profile objects from the flat surface and in a dense clutter environment, plastic cards, domino blocks, Go stones for example, using two-finger parallel jaw gripper having one length-controllable digit. The technique presents the ability to carry out complete bin picking: from the first to the last one. The package includes finger design used, object detection and instance segmentation by Mask-RCNN, scoop-grasp manipulation package.
